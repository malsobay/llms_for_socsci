Both tasks require critical thinking, sharing of knowledge, and collaborative decision-making to achieve the best possible outcome. Task A, on the other hand, is more about visual search and memory recall, which involves different cognitive processes and less analytical discussion compared to the reference task.\n",

Both tasks involve collaborative decision-making, processing of information, and reaching a consensus based on that information.

In the reference task, the team acts as a board of directors evaluating companies for acquisition based on various criteria and must come to an agreement on the rank ordering of the companies. Similarly, in Task B, teams negotiate on behalf of a seller or buyer with specific instructions and goals, requiring them to analyze financial structures and shared information to reach an agreement or decide on an impasse. Both tasks require collaboration, sharing of information, strategic thinking, and a collective decision-making process.

Both tasks involve synthesizing information and collaborating to produce a single output that meets certain criteria.

Similarly, in Task B, participants must analyze data about engine failures and temperatures, discuss their findings, and make a joint decision about whether to proceed with the race, which also requires a consensus. Both tasks involve critical thinking, collaborative decision-making, and the need to synthesize information to reach a 'correct' decision.

Additionally, both tasks involve a form of expert benchmarking – in the reference task, the score is based on the number of targets acquired and 'alive time', while in Task B, the rankings are compared to those of survival experts. Task A, on the other hand, is a logic puzzle that does not inherently require role differentiation or the same level of strategic decision-making based on varied information, as all participants are essentially working on the same logic problem without distinct roles.\n",

Similarly, in Task B, participants must work together to solve a puzzle by mapping letters to numbers, which involves a clear goal (identifying the correct mapping), strategic thinking, and collaboration to achieve the best score in the fewest trials.
