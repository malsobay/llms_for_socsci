    "rationale": "These dimensions were chosen to capture the variety of cognitive and social factors that differentiate the tasks. Task 1 (Ranking) is knowledge-dependent and has objective measurement but low strategic depth. Task 2 (Checkers) is complex, has high strategic depth, and requires no social interaction or moral consideration. Task 3 (Dictator Game) involves social interaction, moral/ethical consideration, and strategic depth to some extent, but is less complex and knowledge-dependent than the other tasks. All tasks have a time constraint, which is a common factor affecting performance.",
