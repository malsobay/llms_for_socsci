They reflect the diversity of skills and abilities required to perform the tasks, ranging from memory and information processing to creativity and strategic thinking. The dimensions also account for the structural aspects of the tasks, such as time constraints and collaboration requirements, which influence how participants approach and complete the tasks. These dimensions were selected to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing the tasks' characteristics and the competencies they assess.",
