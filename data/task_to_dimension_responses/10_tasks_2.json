They also reflect the different social and environmental conditions under which the tasks are performed, such as collaboration, time pressure, and information asymmetry. These dimensions are broad enough to encompass the key aspects of each task while also being distinct, allowing for a clear comparison and contrast between the different types of tasks.",
